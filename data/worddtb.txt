Lenin saw himself as a man of destiny and firmly believed in the righteousness of his cause and his own ability as a revolutionary leader Biographer Louis Fischer described him as a lover of radical change and maximum upheaval a man for whom there was never a middleground He was an eitheror blackorred exaggerator Highlighting Lenins extraordinary capacity for disciplined work and devotion to the revolutionary cause Pipes noted that he exhibited much charisma Similarly Volkogonov believed that by the very force of his personality Lenin had an influence over people Conversely Lenins friend Gorky commented that in his physical appearance as a baldheaded stocky sturdy person the communist revolutionary was too ordinary and did not give the impression of being a leader

    Lenins collected writings reveal in detail a man with iron will selfenslaving selfdiscipline scorn for opponents and obstacles the cold determination of a zealot the drive of a fanatic and the ability to convince or browbeat weaker persons by his singleness of purpose imposing intensity impersonal approach personal sacrifice political astuteness and complete conviction of the possession of the absolute truth His life became the history of the Bolshevik movement

Historian and biographer Robert Service asserted that Lenin had been an intensely emotional young man who exhibited strong hatred for the Tsarist authorities According to Service Lenin developed an emotional attachment to his ideological heroes such as Marx Engels and Chernyshevsky he owned portraits of them and privately described himself as being in love with Marx and Engels According to Lenin biographer James D White Lenin treated their writings as holy writ a religious dogma which should not be questioned but believed in In Volkogonovs view Lenin accepted Marxism as absolute truth and accordingly acted like a religious fanatic Similarly Bertrand Russell felt that Lenin exhibited unwavering faithâ€”religious faith in the Marxian gospel Biographer Christopher Read suggested that Lenin was a secular equivalent of theocratic leaders who derive their legitimacy from the perceived truth of their doctrines not popular mandates Lenin was nevertheless an atheist and a critic of religion believing that socialism was inherently atheistic he thus considered Christian socialism a contradiction in terms

Service stated that Lenin could be moody and volatile and Pipes deemed him to be a thoroughgoing misanthrope a view rejected by Read who highlighted many instances in which Lenin displayed kindness particularly toward children According to several biographers Lenin was intolerant of opposition and often dismissed outright opinions that differed from his own He could be venomous in his critique of others exhibiting a propensity for mockery ridicule and ad hominem attacks on those who disagreed with him He ignored facts that did not suit his argument abhorred compromise and very rarely admitted his own errors He refused to change his opinions until he rejected them completely after which he would treat the new view as if it was just as unchangeable Lenin showed no sign of sadism or of personally desiring to commit violent acts but he endorsed the violent actions of others and exhibited no remorse for those killed for the revolutionary cause Adopting an amoral stance in Lenins view the end always justified the means according to Service Lenins criterion of morality was simple does a certain action advance or hinder the cause of the Revolution

    The Lenin who seemed externally so gentle and goodnatured who enjoyed a laugh who loved animals and was prone to sentimental reminiscences was transformed when class or political questions arose He at once became savagely sharp uncompromising remorseless and vengeful Even in such a state he was capable of black humour

Aside from Russian Lenin spoke and read French German and English Concerned with physical fitness he exercised regularly enjoyed cycling swimming and hunting and also developed a passion for mountain walking in the Swiss peaks He was also fond of pets in particular cats Tending to eschew luxury he lived a spartan lifestyle and Pipes noted that Lenin was exceedingly modest in his personal wants leading an austere almost ascetic style of life Lenin despised untidiness always keeping his work desk tidy and his pencils sharpened and insisted on total silence while he was working According to Fischer Lenins vanity was minimal and for this reason he disliked the cult of personality that the Soviet administration began to build around him he nevertheless accepted that it might have some benefits in unifying the communist movement

Despite his revolutionary politics Lenin disliked revolutionary experimentation in literature and the arts expressing his dislike of expressionism futurism and cubism and conversely favouring realism and Russian classic literature Lenin also had a conservative attitude towards sex and marriage Throughout his adult life he was in a relationship with Krupskaya a fellow Marxist whom he married Lenin and Krupskaya both regretted that they never had children and they enjoyed entertaining their friends offspring Read noted that Lenin had very close warm lifelong relationships with his close family members he had no lifelong friends and Armand has been cited as being his only close intimate confidante

Ethnically Lenin identified as Russian Service described Lenin as a bit of a snob in national social and cultural terms The Bolshevik leader believed that other European countries especially Germany were culturally superior to Russia describing the latter as one of the most benighted medieval and shamefully backward of Asian countries He was annoyed at what he perceived as a lack of conscientiousness and discipline among the Russian people and from his youth had wanted Russia to become more culturally European and Western
